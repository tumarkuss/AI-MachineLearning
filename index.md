# Hello! This is Tumar Kussainov's AI/Machine Learning repository:

I will not be posting my [personal project](www.github.com/tumarkuss/AI-MachineLearning-Practice/MatchAI) documentation here yet. But some of the techniques and AI practices will be available in the [Practice](www.github.com/tumarkuss/AI-MachineLearning-Practice/Practice) directory. I will be more than glad to share some of my work with you in exchange for your opinion; feel free to [contact me](mailto:tumarkuss@gmail.com)

## My tech experience:
```markdown
I am a senior year student at Pace University, majoring in Computer Science(B.S.).
Up to my first year at Berkeley City College, I had no understanding of CS
and the only programming experience I have worked with by that time
were HTML, CSS, Pascal :(

# Today, despite of all the douts and challenges, my coding experience is not so bad:)

- 1 year - Swift and C.
- 1,5 years - Python.
- 3 years - Java, C++.
- Familiar with - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API developement

- 2 internships
- 3 personal projects
  and
# Most importantly: experience, knowledge and friends!
 # And I am beginning my new journey
```
## Why AI?

```markdown
  I think every abmitious coder wants to launch a startup and be on top of the world, but realistic coder
wants to be a part and contribute into some innovative and outstanding technology through hard work,
everyday practice and team appreciacion.

1. AI is literally magic, and mastering this craft would bring unique dividents.
2. It is innovative and rewarding with many real-life applications.
3. AI combines many CS fields in one. Machine Learning alone is not enough to have a successful AI.
4. Gives freedom of creativity. We are used that Datastructures are all defined, and everything in coding is the way it is,
and BST is the best sorting method period. There no such things in AI. No rules or stereotypes. Enjoy!
5. The Industry will undoubtedly be booming in the near future, and the earlier Engineers
start working on AI developemnt, the better it will for them and future of the businesses, economy, tech, the people.
6. Uncertainty provides less competitive career opportunities for the engineers.
